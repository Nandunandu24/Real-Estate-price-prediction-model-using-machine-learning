If you want to learn how to predict real estate prices, this article is for you. In this article, Iâ€™ll take you through the task of Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

Below is the process we can follow for real estate price prediction to help individuals and businesses make informed decisions in the real estate market:

Gather relevant data from various sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and other public or private sources.
Clean and prepare the collected data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
Create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information that can influence real estate prices.
Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models for the task.
Train the selected model on the training data, optimizing its parameters to make accurate predictions.
For the task of Real Estate Price Prediction, we need historical data with various features that can influence property prices. I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the dataset# Real-Estate-price-prediction-model-using-machine-learning
